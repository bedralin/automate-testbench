automate-testbench
==================

In this repository, I am open-sourcing some of my code used to automate a certain test-bench. 
You may use these as examples to start your own fun automation of hardware. I noticed that 
there was not much information online about automating test-benches so I am giving you some 
sample code of what I have to get you started. I can not give you my full automation code, 
because this may be sensitive information which I am not allowed to give. Just keep in mind,
when writing your automation script, pay attention to the timing. So critical!

Without their support, none of this would be possible.

In order for this to work, you must install the package called python-vxi11: \n
