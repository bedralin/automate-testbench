automate-testbench
==================

In this repository, I am open-sourcing some of my code used to automate a certain test-bench. 
You may use these as examples to start your own fun automation of hardware. I noticed that 
there was not much information online about automating test-benches so I am giving you some 
sample code of what I have to get you started.

Without their support, none of this would be possible.

In order for this to work, you must install the package called python-vxi11:
